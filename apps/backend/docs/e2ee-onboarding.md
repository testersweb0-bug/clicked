# E2EE onboarding sequence

This document describes the backend E2EE onboarding flow implemented today for device registration and prekey upload, and how a client should sequence first-contact DM setup on top of those APIs.

It covers:

1. happy path
2. offline-recipient path
3. prekey-exhausted path

It also records the exact request/response JSON shapes implemented by the current backend endpoints and the ordering guarantees clients can rely on.

## Scope and current backend surface

The currently implemented backend endpoints involved in onboarding are:

- `POST /auth/challenge`
- `POST /auth/verify`
- `GET /devices`
- `POST /devices/:id/prekeys`

There is **currently no implemented backend endpoint in this repo** for:

- fetching another user's E2EE device bundle
- atomically consuming a recipient one-time prekey
- server-side session creation
- sending encrypted DM envelopes

Those later steps are part of the intended product flow, but they are not exposed by implemented backend routes in `apps/backend/src/routes` yet. This doc therefore does two things:

- documents the **exact JSON that exists now** for onboarding/device-prekey registration
- documents the **required sequencing and guarantees** for first-DM bundle fetch/session/envelope send so future endpoints preserve compatibility with the existing implementation

## Actors

- **Sender client**: the device initiating onboarding or first DM
- **Recipient client**: the target device/user for a first DM
- **Backend API**: Express app in `apps/backend/src/routes`

## Implemented data model

The implemented E2EE-related tables are defined in `apps/backend/src/db/schema.ts`.

### Device

A device row is created during `POST /auth/verify` keyed by `(userId, identityPublicKey)`.

Stored shape:

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "userId": "uuid",
  "identityPublicKey": "base64-ed25519-spki-der",
  "isRevoked": false,
  "createdAt": "timestamp",
  "updatedAt": "timestamp"
}
```

Notes:

- `identityPublicKey` is the long-term device identity public key.
- device lookup during verify is by `userId + identityPublicKey`
- revoked devices cannot sign in again

### Signed prekey

Exactly one signed prekey is stored per device.

Stored shape:

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "deviceId": "uuid",
  "keyId": 1,
  "publicKey": "base64",
  "signature": "base64",
  "createdAt": "timestamp"
}
```

Notes:

- uniqueness is enforced on `deviceId`
- uploading replaces the previous signed prekey for that device

### One-time prekey

Stored shape:

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "deviceId": "uuid",
  "keyId": 10,
  "publicKey": "base64",
  "createdAt": "timestamp"
}
```

Notes:

- uniqueness is enforced on `(deviceId, keyId)`
- max stored one-time prekeys per device is `200`
- duplicate uploads are ignored on conflict

## Exact implemented endpoint JSON

### 1) Client requests auth challenge

Endpoint:

```text
POST /auth/challenge
```

Request JSON:

```json
{
  "walletAddress": "G..."
}
```

Response JSON:

```json
{
  "message": "Sign in to Clicked\nWallet: G...\nNonce: abc123",
  "nonce": "abc123"
}
```

Ordering guarantees:

- client must call this before `POST /auth/verify`
- returned `nonce` must be echoed unchanged to `POST /auth/verify`
- the backend consumes the nonce during verify, so the same nonce is single-use from the client's perspective

### 2) Client verifies wallet signature and registers/resolves device

Endpoint:

```text
POST /auth/verify
```

Request JSON:

```json
{
  "walletAddress": "G...",
  "signature": "signature-string",
  "nonce": "abc123",
  "identityPublicKey": "base64-ed25519-spki-der"
}
```

Success response JSON:

```json
{
  "token": "jwt"
}
```

Possible error JSON:

```json
{ "error": "Invalid or expired nonce" }
```

```json
{ "error": "Signature verification failed" }
```

```json
{ "error": "Invalid signature or wallet address" }
```

```json
{ "error": "Device has been revoked" }
```

```json
{ "error": "Failed to create user" }
```

```json
{ "error": "Failed to register device" }
```

Behavior and guarantees:

1. nonce is validated and consumed first
2. wallet signature is verified second
3. user and wallet are resolved/upserted third
4. device is resolved by `(userId, identityPublicKey)` fourth
5. if no device exists, a new device row is inserted
6. returned JWT includes the backend device row id as `deviceId`

Important ordering guarantee:

- a client must not attempt `POST /devices/:id/prekeys` until it has successfully completed `POST /auth/verify` and extracted the authenticated device id from the returned JWT context

## How the device id is obtained after verify

`POST /auth/verify` returns only:

```json
{
  "token": "jwt"
}
```

The backend signs the token with payload fields including:

```json
{
  "userId": "uuid",
  "walletAddress": "G...",
  "deviceId": "uuid"
}
```

So the authenticated device id used in subsequent calls is the `deviceId` embedded in the JWT.

## 3) Client uploads prekeys

Endpoint:

```text
POST /devices/:id/prekeys
```

Auth:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-from-auth-verify>
```

Path parameter:

- `:id` must be the authenticated backend device row id from the JWT

Request JSON:

```json
{
  "signedPreKey": {
    "keyId": 1,
    "publicKey": "base64",
    "signature": "base64"
  },
  "oneTimePreKeys": [
    {
      "keyId": 10,
      "publicKey": "base64"
    },
    {
      "keyId": 11,
      "publicKey": "base64"
    }
  ]
}
```

Success response JSON:

```json
{
  "uploadedSignedPreKey": true,
  "uploadedOneTimePreKeys": 2,
  "capped": false
}
```

Success response when batch is trimmed by the cap:

```json
{
  "uploadedSignedPreKey": true,
  "uploadedOneTimePreKeys": 1,
  "capped": true
}
```

Possible error JSON:

```json
{ "error": "Device not found" }
```

```json
{ "error": "Only the device owner may upload prekeys" }
```

```json
{ "error": "Device is revoked" }
```

```json
{ "error": "Signed prekey signature is invalid" }
```

```json
{ "error": "One-time prekey cap of 200 reached. Consume existing prekeys before uploading more." }
```

Validation constraints:

- `signedPreKey.keyId` is a non-negative integer
- `signedPreKey.publicKey` is required
- `signedPreKey.signature` is required
- `oneTimePreKeys` must contain at least one item
- each one-time prekey must include non-negative integer `keyId` and required `publicKey`

Behavior and guarantees:

1. authenticated caller is checked first
2. referenced device row is loaded second
3. ownership is enforced third
4. revoked devices are rejected fourth
5. signed prekey signature is verified against `device.identityPublicKey` fifth
6. current one-time prekey count is checked sixth
7. signed prekey upsert runs before one-time prekey inserts
8. one-time prekeys are inserted with conflict-ignore semantics
9. response reports how many one-time prekeys from the incoming batch were accepted after cap trimming

Important ordering guarantees:

- signed prekey upload and one-time prekey upload happen in a single request
- the device's signed prekey is always written before any one-time prekey insert in handler order
- if the device already has `200` one-time prekeys stored, the request is rejected with `422` and nothing new is uploaded
- if the incoming batch would exceed the cap, the server trims the batch to fit the remaining slots instead of rejecting the whole request
- duplicate one-time prekeys by `(deviceId, keyId)` are ignored by the database conflict rule

## Sequence: happy path

This is the intended first-time onboarding and first-DM path.

```

### Recipient bundle shape required for first DM

This bundle-fetch endpoint is **not implemented yet in this repo**, but the sender's first-DM flow requires at minimum the following data, because it is what the implemented schema stores today:

```json
{
  "userId": "uuid",
  "devices": [
    {
      "deviceId": "uuid",
      "identityPublicKey": "base64-ed25519-spki-der",
      "signedPreKey": {
        "keyId": 1,
        "publicKey": "base64",
        "signature": "base64"
      },
      "oneTimePreKey": {
        "keyId": 10,
        "publicKey": "base64"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Client expectations for the happy path:

1. fetch recipient bundle after sender has uploaded its own prekeys
2. use recipient `identityPublicKey`
3. verify recipient `signedPreKey.signature` against recipient `identityPublicKey`
4. use a consumed recipient `oneTimePreKey` if present
5. establish the initial session locally
6. encrypt one envelope per recipient device and send them through the messaging path

## Sequence: offline-recipient path

In the offline-recipient path, the recipient client is not connected, but has already onboarded and uploaded prekeys.

```text
Sender client                     Backend                          Recipient client
  |                                 |                                   |
  |-- fetch recipient bundle ------>|                                   |
  |<- bundle with signedPreKey -----|                                   |
  |   and oneTimePreKey             |                                   |
  |                                 |                                   |
  |-- establish session locally ----|                                   |
  |                                 |                                   |
  |-- send encrypted envelopes ---->|---- stores/queues envelopes ----->|
  |                                 |                                   |
  |                                 |<--- recipient later comes online --|
  |                                 |---- recipient receives envelope -->|
```

Required guarantees for this path:

- recipient need not be online if the backend can return a valid bundle with at least identity key + signed prekey
- bundle fetch must reserve or consume at most one one-time prekey per recipient device for the session-init message
- envelope send must be durable enough for later delivery

How this maps to the implemented code today:

- the preconditions for offline delivery already exist: device identity keys, one signed prekey per device, and a stock of one-time prekeys per device
- the actual bundle-fetch and envelope-storage routes are not yet implemented in this repo

## Sequence: prekey-exhausted path

This path happens when the recipient has no one-time prekeys left, or when a sender-side device has reached the upload cap and needs replenishment handling.

### A) Sender upload cap exhausted

This part is implemented today.

```text
Client                           Backend
  |                                 |
  |-- POST /devices/:id/prekeys --->|
  |                                 |
  |<- 422 { error: "One-time       -|
  |          prekey cap of 200      |
  |          reached..." }          |
```

Client behavior:

- do not retry the same upload blindly
- wait until existing one-time prekeys have been consumed, or rotate strategy client-side
- if partial capacity remains, respect `uploadedOneTimePreKeys` and `capped: true`

### B) Recipient one-time prekeys exhausted

This recipient-side fetch path is **not implemented yet in this repo**, but the expected behavior for first DM should be:

```text
Sender client                     Backend
  |                                 |
  |-- fetch recipient bundle ------>|
  |<- bundle with identity key -----|
  |   + signed prekey only          |
  |   + no oneTimePreKey            |
  |                                 |
  |-- establish fallback session ---|
  |   using signed prekey only      |
  |                                 |
  |-- send prekey envelope -------->|
```

Required JSON shape for prekey-exhausted bundle response:

```json
{
  "userId": "uuid",
  "devices": [
    {
      "deviceId": "uuid",
      "identityPublicKey": "base64-ed25519-spki-der",
      "signedPreKey": {
        "keyId": 1,
        "publicKey": "base64",
        "signature": "base64"
      },
      "oneTimePreKey": null
    }
  ]
}
```

Required guarantees for this path:

- absence of a one-time prekey must be explicit, not ambiguous
- signed prekey must still be present if the device remains reachable for session bootstrap
- client must treat this as lower-entropy/fallback first-contact establishment and should trigger recipient prekey replenishment UX when possible

## End-to-end ordering contract

For compatibility with the current implementation, clients should rely on this ordering:

1. generate local identity keypair
2. call `POST /auth/challenge`
3. sign the challenge message with the wallet
4. call `POST /auth/verify` with `identityPublicKey`
5. receive JWT containing backend `deviceId`
6. call `POST /devices/:deviceId/prekeys`
7. only after successful prekey upload, attempt first-DM recipient bundle fetch
8. establish session locally from recipient bundle
9. send encrypted envelope(s)

### Ordering rules clients can assume today

- a device cannot upload prekeys before it has authenticated and been resolved to a backend device id
- a revoked device cannot authenticate or upload prekeys
- a signed prekey is validated against the stored device identity key before it is accepted
- one-time prekeys are capped at 200 stored keys per device
- prekey upload returns the accepted count so the client can reconcile local inventory

## Implementation references

- auth challenge/verify: `apps/backend/src/routes/auth.ts`
- auth request schema: `apps/backend/src/schemas/auth.schemas.ts`
- device/prekey upload: `apps/backend/src/routes/devices.ts`
- E2EE-related schema: `apps/backend/src/db/schema.ts`
- prekey route tests: `apps/backend/src/__tests__/devices.prekeys.test.ts`

## Gaps to close for full first-DM support

To fully implement the flow described in the issue, backend work still needs routes for:

- recipient bundle fetch
- atomic one-time prekey reservation/consumption
- encrypted envelope submit/store/deliver
- explicit multi-device fanout semantics for first-contact DM

This document is written so those routes can be added without changing the already implemented onboarding JSON and ordering contract.
